      <!-- delete PROPOSED after AC review completed -->

      <p class="mission">The <strong>mission</strong> of the <a href="">Editing Working Group</a> is to explore limitations in existing browser primitives, provide use cases for new APIs and suggest solutions either by standardizing of existing behaviors or introducing new APIs <strong>relevant for text editing</strong>. The goal is to facilitate the creation of fully-featured editing systems as well as small editors using JavaScript.</p>

        <h2>Scope</h2>
	      <h3 id="background">Background</h3>
        <p>Enabling rich editing experience on the web is currently a challenging task. One of the reasons is lack of requirements in the behavior of the contenteditable attribute in HTML. Currently, it is the only browser primitive providing rich editing surface to web developers. Also, there is a limited support for low-level editing APIs that would allow web developers to build rich editing experiences without getting browsers interference in this process.</p>
	      <h3 id="in-scope">In Scope</h3>
        <p>The scope of Editing WG covers all aspects of text editing, which may include:
          <ul>
            <li>Textual input and text manipulation.</li>
            <li>Text editing related events.</li>
            <li>Selection.</li>
            <li>Clipboard.</li>
            <li>Undo.</li>
            <li>Spellcheck and grammar checking.</li>
            <li>Revisiting of under-specified existing editing related features.</li>
            <li>Incubating features related to text editing that may eventually go under the scope of another WG, e.g. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-highlight-api-1/">Highlight API</a>.</li>
          </ul></p>

        <section id="section-out-of-scope">
          <h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>
            <p>The following features are out of scope and will not be addressed by this Working group.</p>

            <ul class="out-of-scope">
              <li>
                Non DOM-based editing, e.g. canvas or media content.
              </li>
              <li>
                Editing of content other than text and text related content. For example, an image editor, a 3D modeler or a movie cutter would be out of scope.

	  <h2>Success Criteria</h2>
	  <p>The Working Group is successful if it has been able to produce specs and standardize browser behavior so that it is possible to write a basic JS text editor that works across writing systems with no more than 3 years development effort.</p>
	  <p>Each specification should contain a section detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
	  <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>
	  <p>Each specification should contain a section on accessibility, privacy, internationalization that describe the benefits and impacts, including ways specification features can be used to address them, and
		recommendations for maximizing aforementioned topics in implementations.</p>
	  <p>To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications should have <a href='https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html'>tests</a> where applicable.</p>
	</section>

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for
          accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
          Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.  The Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of
          each specification.  The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged
          to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.</p>

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

      	<p class="todo">In addition to the above catch-all reference to horizontal review which includes accessibility review, please check with chairs and staff contacts of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/">Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group</a> to determine if an additional liaison statement with more specific information about concrete review issues is needed in the list below.</p>

        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>

          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.

          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from <span id='cfc'> 7 working days</span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
